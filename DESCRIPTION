Authors@R: person("Dajun", "Tian", email = "tiandajun@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Given an existing database connection and a file containing SQL code, sqlTXT separates the SQL code
  into single query and submits it sequentially. The results from select are returned as a list of
  data frames. If comments are in the code, it should only use the form of "--comment" at
  the beginning of the line.
